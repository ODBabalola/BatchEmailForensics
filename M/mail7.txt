Dear Prof. Martin,

Thank you for the update. I am happy with the arrangements made and all is
in order.

I would like to ask if we have all been appointed and noted as tutors for
COS332 on the appointment system? Considering I had withdrawn my
application and you had mentioned that the system was not working
correctly. Or rather is this all still being processed?

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Peter Okumbe
