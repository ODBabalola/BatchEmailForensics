Good Day Mrs Rananga

I am contacting to enquire further details regarding the selection of a
research topic and supervisor. I have recently had two separate meetings
with a lecturer, we are close on finalizing a topic. Should I come to you
with the proposed supervisor form including topic, and if so by when must I
do so?

Kind regards
Daniel Babalola
