Dear All,

Sorry about taking so long to schedule the practical events.

Peter and Daniel have clashes on Tuesdays.  Therefore, I would appreciate
it if Rachel and Lionel can handle the Tuesday sessions (16:30-19:20).
(Lionel, sorry about not being able to accommodate you on a Friday).
Tuesday sessions will take place in the Informatorium, as scheduled (Purple
and Green labs).

Then Peter, Daniel and Rachel can handle the sessions on Fridays.  (Rachel,
I've noted that you will not be available one Friday per month, but to make
up for that, may I ask you to enter the marks on Excel for all eight
practical sessions?)   The Friday sessions will be from 9:30-12:30.  We
will start in the Informatorium (Blue labs) for the first hour, because it
overlaps with our reserved space in the Informatorium.  I will find another
venue for the remaining two hours.

The first assignments are to be demonstrated next week (22 and 25 March).
I'll send a marking rubric over the weekend.

I am looking forward to working with you this year.  Thank you for your
willingness to assist.

Regards
Martin Olivier
