Dear Prof Martin,

Thank you for your email. I am ok with the Tuesday slot. I have research
group meetings on every last Friday of the month (8:30-11:00) which would
affect Pracs1, 4 and 8 Friday sessions. If a session were to be on
Thursday, it would be fine with me. Many thanks.

Kind Regards

Rachel
