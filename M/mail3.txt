Dear Prof. Olivier,

I would be available for the Thursday session anytime before 16:30 or the
Friday morning session could also work for me anytime before 12:30.

I will however not be available to attend the Tuesday session from
16:30-19:30 due to a lecture at the same scheduled time.

Kind regards,
Peter Okumbe
